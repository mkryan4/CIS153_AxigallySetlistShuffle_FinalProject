Around Us All,0.01,120,02:55,C minor,55,45,90,75,50,"Maybe need to make a song that goes after it (a part 2, I mean) - John needs to do his lead part, Eric needs to record bass (or keyboards) and maybe do some backing vocals"
Getting to Know Myself,0.02,140,05:22,B? major,50,80,85,55,10,"Maybe needs a little drum update, some minor touch-ups - this is our best-produced track so far"
Pulse,0.03,70,03:33,F# major,25,40,95,75,15,"John & Eric need to play their parts, you need to re-record whatever vocals you're not happy with, and probably fix the drums in a few places"
Cold Day in Hell,0.04,97,05:36,A major,20,80,90,60,0,"Need to get this moved into its own folder in Windows, then the vocals need to be re-recorded, need to get a better violin sound (and sub guitar for the part at Eric's suggestion), drums in the bridge need attention"
Jesters and Kings,0.05,88,04:26,E? minor,85,65,80,50,15,John's working on remaking this one last we spoke (though there was a delay since he was in Ireland for two weeks) - we'll see how this turns out
Coma,0.06,77,04:01,B minor,45,40,95,70,10,"Not sure what the guys think about this, and not sure covers are the way to go, but it's fun! :-)"
Fall in Love with Me Again,0.07,120,05:06,D minor,50,80,90,45,5,"Maybe needs a little drum update, some Tuning or re-recording on the vocals, I think it needs more BG vocals, either from me alone, or me and Eric"
The Next Best Thing to Heaven,0.08,96,04:29,D minor,70,45,90,80,30,"Need to re-record the BG vocals (and adjust or kill tuning) as well as maybe some lead vox, John needs to record his parts, and Eric his (probably including some BG vocals)"
Overwise,0.09,100,04:10,F minor,30,40,95,65,10,"Nearly all vocals need to be re-recorded (you were still sick), need to add Mint Guitar (etc.), a better piano, of course John and Eric need to record whatever they're going to play"
Novadawn,0.1,90,05:33,F# major,25,50,95,85,5,"If Nora Jones won't sing it, you might see about finding someone who can sound like that, or maybe you can try it another way. :-)  If John & Eric want to play on it, that'd be awesome"
Contact,0.11,140,03:47,A? minor,30,70,95,60,10,"Might want to try adding a few things to this to modernize the sound a little. Not sure what, but it does need a little more brightness - it sounds of its era (it was completed in 2007, I believe it was)"
Understanding,0.12,110,03:06,C major,85,35,85,80,40,"The basic structure is done, but needs the ""secret sauce"" from John & Eric's original recording because Matt's version sounds comparatively very thin. Also needs way better lyrics than it has right now"
