# CIS153_AxigallySetlistShuffle_FinalProject
My final project for DMACC CIS153 Spring 2025
## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse).
3. Make sure the file `AxigallyDatabase.csv` is located **in the root folder of the project**, not inside `/src`.
4. Compile and run `Main.java` to launch the GUI.

If you get a file not found error, make sure `AxigallyDatabase.csv` is in the same directory as your `/src` folder.
